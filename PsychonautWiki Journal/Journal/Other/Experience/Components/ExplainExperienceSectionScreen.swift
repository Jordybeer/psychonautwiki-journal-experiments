The peak and offset durations are linearly interpolated based on the dose if possible, else it just chooses the middle value of the range. If some of the durations are missing it draws a dotted line. E.g. if the onset and total time is given it draws a line along the bottom for the onset and then it draws a dotted curve to the end of the total time.")
